What makes us special is that our staff are DIY enthusiasts and many are specialists in various areas of DIY, so not only will you get a friendly service but they are genuinely helpful too and would be happy to chat through any questions you have and offer advice. Also, if there’s something that you can’t see on our website or in our store, it doesn’t mean we don’t have it or couldn’t order it for you, so always ask and we’ll see what we can do!

Our product of the month this month is our great value snow shovel. After the last couple of years we think you should be prepared! If you buy the snow shovel and our children’s sledge together, we will give you 20% off the total price – BARGAIN!

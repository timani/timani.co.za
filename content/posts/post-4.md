description: "Start by getting a small backpack (less than 20 liters) and then just travel with what fits in that."

I’m on a trip at the moment, and a friend who generously let me sleep on his couch looked at my small travel backpack and commented on how little I travel with: “That’s impressive,” he said.

I was a little surprised, because though I’ve gotten that comment before, it’s become normal for me to travel with just a small bag (10 lbs. or less, usually), and I have friends who travel with even less. But then I remembered that I’m far from normal in this way.

#### Cost of downtime

<p><img src="/images/ic/cost-of-downtime.png"></p>

For cold places, I have thermal underwear and a couple long-sleeve layers (generally all Patagonia capilene stuff), and a beanie. I don’t usually go to places where it’s snowing (I don’t know why, maybe snow isn’t my thing), so I don’t have clothes to deal with that weather.

### Why

For warm places, I will bring flip flops and swim trunks, and leave most of the colder layers behind.

> A number like that makes for sensational headlines, but it’s hard to wrap your head around. Per-company figures are more down-to-earth: Gartner cites $5,600 per minute—about $300,000 per hour—in its estimates.

Lightweight stuff that I can layer. Often they’re workout-style clothes or things from companies like Outlier or Patagonia that travel well.


Loss of trust
Loss of revenue
Failure to meet business outcomes


### Why is Incident management so difficult?

We ran the numbers of the top US ecommerce sites to see what an hour of downtime costs them. For example, Amazon.com would lose $13.22 million dollars for a single hour of downtime.

* Lack of common language
* People first. I bring clothes that I can wash in the sink or shower and that will dry overnight.
* I don’t bring enough underwear or socks for every day of the trip, because I wash them every couple of days.
* I only bring one or two extra T-shirts, generally wearing the same two shirts the whole trip,
* even if it’s a month long. No one has ever once cared what I wear when I’m traveling.

### Why is Incident management so difficult?

## Principles of incident management

* Embracing Risk
* Psychological Safety
* Emotional labor
* Continuous Improvement


### Psychological Safety

> Psychological safety is a shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking.[1] It can be defined as "being able to show and employ one's self without fear of negative consequences of self-image, status or career" (Kahn 1990, p. 708).[2] In psychologically safe teams, team members feel accepted and respected.

#### Risks


### Emotional labor


## How do we go about improving this?

* Design thinking
* Human Centered Design

### Design thinking

For me, having those roller bags is lugging too much, because you can run up stairs with it with ease, or carry it all over a city without worrying about stowing away your luggage somewhere first. It’s so much easier to travel ultralight.

### 4 Golden metrics

That’s enough for a monthlong trip, which I’ve done multiple times with this kind of setup. For a shorter trip of a few days, I might bring even less.

1. Raw Incident Count
2. Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR)
3. Time to Acknowledgement / Time to Response
4. Escalations

I bring minimal toiletries: a small shaver for my head, razor, toothbrush, floss small tubes of toothpaste and shaving cream, deodorant, nail clippers, ibuprofen.
